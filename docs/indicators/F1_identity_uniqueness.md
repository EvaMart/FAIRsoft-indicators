# F1. Identity Uniqueness 

The software has a proper, unique and persistent identifier. The uniqueness of an identifier is a necessary condition to unambiguously refer to that resource, and that resource alone. 

- ### F1.1. Uniqueness of name

    The software has a unique name to identify it 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  The name is commonly used as the main identifier of a software. Each tool should have a unique name to avoid ambiguities. Different versions of the same software should share a name, but if substantial modifications in the algorithm are done, the identifier should change for the new piece of software.|  A name is valid. | all | 



- ### F1.2. Identifiability of version

    There is a scheme to uniquely and properly identify the software version.

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |A version scheme is necessary to refer to a specific release of a software and keep track of the incrementally different versions of the software.| A version of the form X.X is considered valid.| all|
