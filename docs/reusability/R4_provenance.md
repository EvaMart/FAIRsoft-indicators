    A version-control system is used to track changes in the software.

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  | 
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Version control ensures the changes in software are recorded and searchable. | A repository either in github or sourceForge is considered valid  | all |

- ### R4.2. Existence of release policy

    The software follows a defined and documented release policy. 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Without a release policy, users cannot know the differences between versions of a software. | Not measured  | all |

- ### R4.3. Metadata of previous versions at software repositories 

    Metadata of previous versions is available. 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------| 
    | Even if the code/functionality is missing, the existence of metadata for a given version of a software, used in a published research the user is interested in, for instance, enables them to be certain about the past existence of a software and relevant details about it. | Not measured | all |
