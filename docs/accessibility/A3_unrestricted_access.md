# A3.  Unrestricted access

In general, research software should be designed to be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users, diverse in expertise and geographical location. Thus, it is usually highly desirable that research software has few restrictions in terms of authorization and infrastructure/platform needed to use it.


!!! note 

    However, although low restrictions make software more accessible, there are still cases where restrictions may be necessary. For example, some software may be designed to be used to handle sensitive data, and thus, it may be necessary to restrict access to the software to authorized users. In other cases, the software may be designed to work with a specific infrastructure or platform for the sake of reliability and/or performance. 

- ### F1.1. Uniqueness of name

    The software has a unique name to identify it 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  The name is commonly used as the main identifier of a software. Each tool should have a unique name to avoid ambiguities. Different versions of the same software should share a name, but if substantial modifications in the algorithm are done, the identifier should change for the new piece of software.|  A name is valid. | all |
