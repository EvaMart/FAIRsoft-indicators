# A3.  Unrestricted access

In general, research software should be designed to be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users, diverse in expertise and geographical location. Thus, it is usually highly desirable that research software has few restrictions in terms of authorization and infrastructure/platform needed to use it.


!!! note 

    Although low restrictions make software more accessible, there are still cases where restrictions may be necessary. For example, some software may be designed to be used to handle sensitive data, and thus, it may be necessary to restrict access to the software to authorized users. In other cases, the software may be designed to work with a specific infrastructure or platform for the sake of reliability and/or performance. 

- ### A3.1. Registration compulsory

    The software can be used without registration
 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Registration is a barrier for accessibility, since users may not want to give personal information. | Not currently measured | all | 

- ### A3.2. Availability of version for free Operating System 

    Whether the software can be used in a free operating system

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Non-free operating systems are a barrier for accessibility. | Linux among the compatible Operating Systems is considered valid. | non-web |

- ### A3.3. Availability for several Operating Systems 

    There are versions of the software for several operative systems  

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Supporting multiple operating systems makes the software more accessible to users with diverse needs, constraints and preferences.  | At least two compatible Operating Systems are considered valid. | non-web |

- ### A3.4. Availability on free e-infrastructures 

    Software can be used in a free e-infrastructure such as a useGalaxy instance. 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | e-infrastructures are we web-based services that provide computational resources to users. They are accessible theough a web browser, requiring no building or installation in the susers system. They are a good way to make software accessible to a wide range of users. | A useGalaxy or VRE public instance is considered valid. | non-web | 

- ### A3.5. Availability on several e-infrastructures 

    Software can be used in several e-infrastructure instances. 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Users usually use e-infrastructures to build workflows. The e-infrastructure they choose to use, thus, depends on several softwares being available in the same platform and other factors. The more e-infrastructures a software is available in, the greater the likelihood a user will be able to use it. | At least two useGalaxy or VRE public instances are considered valid. | non-web |
