# A1.  Existence of available working version

    
- ### A1.1. Existence of API or web interfaces

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Remote access to the tool requires only internet access from users and other software, increasing the usability of the resource.  | The software has a public API or web interface. | web |

- ### A1.2. Existence of downloadable and buildable software working version 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Many users want to be able to install and run the software where and as they wish. Other times, it is imperative to install the resource locally to be able to use it (modules, for instance). A downloadable and buildable version greatly increases the freedom of use and usability of software. | At least one working download link is considered valid. | non-web | 

- ### A1.3. Existence of installation instructions 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | A guideline to install the software might be absolutely necessary to successfully build a software. In all cases, it greatly increases the probability of successful installation. | A link explicitly stated as installation instruction or manual, instructions on the web if Bioconductor package, availability through Galaxy ToolShed are all considered valid. | non-web | 

- ### A1.4. Existence of test data 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Test data allows the user to make sure the program works as expected and serves as an example of working data the user can look at when preparing its own data and learning to use the software. |At least one piece of test data is considered valid. | non-web | all | 

- ### A1.5. Existence of software source code 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Source code can be compiled to work in any operating system, and help the user to solve installation and running issues (i.e. dealing with dependencies). The solution to these issues can even be a modification in the code. Source code is the only way to understand how the software works and to modify it to suit the user's needs. | A link explicitly stated as source code is considered valid. | non-web |
