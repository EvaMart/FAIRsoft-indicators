    Whether there is available metadata of previous versions

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | Even if the code/functionality is missing, the existence of metadata for a given version of a software provides evidence of  its previous existence  and relevant details. | Not measured | all | 


- ### A2.2. Existence of accessible previous versions of the software 

    Whether there are available previous versions

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |

    | Necessary to be able to reproduce analyses with the original software versions. In addtion, even if the code/functionality is missing, the existence of previous versions of a software provides evidence of its previous existence  and relevant details. | Not measured | all |
