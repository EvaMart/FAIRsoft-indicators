# I2. Workflow compatibility 

 Whether software can be deployed in a format to be included in pipelines.

- ### I2.1 Availability of API /library versions.

  Whether the software has API /library versions to be included in users' pipelines 
  
    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  It is common for users to want to use a piece of software as a part of a pipeline. In order to do so, the software must be accessible in the proper form, such as modules that can be loaded into other code or an API to connect.  | A library or API version of the software is available.  | all | 
   
- ### I2.2 Availability in e-infrastructures 

    Whether the software can be deployed in e-infrastructures (e. g. Galaxy) 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  E-infraestructures are used by many to build pipelines and process their data. The impossibility to deploy a software in them prevents it from being used by these users. | The software is available at the Galaxy Toolshed.  | all |
