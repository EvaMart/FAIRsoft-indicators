# Findability indicators 

The following table lists the indicators that are used to measure the findability of a software.

| [**F1.  Identity Uniqueness**](../findability/F1_identity_uniqueness.md) | The software has a proper, unique and persistent identifier. |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [F1.1 Uniqueness of name](../findability/F1_identity_uniqueness/#f11-uniqueness-of-name)   | The software has a unique name to identify it |
| [F1.2. Identifiability of version](../findability/F1_identity_uniqueness/#f12-identifiability-of-version) | There is a scheme to uniquely and properly identify the software version. |
| [** F2. Existence of Metadata **](../findability/F2_existence_of_metadata.md) | **The software is described with rich metadata, including scientific applicability.** |
| [F2.1. Structured Metadata](../findability/F2_existence_of_metadata/#f21-structured-metadata)   | Metadata is adjusted to specific metadata formats |
| [F2.2. Standardized Metadata](../findability/F2_existence_of_metadata/#f22-standardized-metadata)  | Metadata is described using accepted ontologies  |
| [** F3. Searchability **](../findability/F3_searchability.md) | **How software can be found. **|
| [F3.1. Searchability in registries](../findability/F3_searchability#f31-searchability-in-registries)   | The software is included in the main software registries. |
| [F3.2. Searchability in software repositories](../findability/F3_searchability#f32-searchability-in-software-repositories)  | The software is included in the main software repositories. |
| [F3.3. Searchability in search engines](../findability/F3_searchability#f33-searchability-in-literature)  | The software is indexed by search engines. |
