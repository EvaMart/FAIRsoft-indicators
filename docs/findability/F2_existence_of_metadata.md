# F2. Existence of Metadata
The software is described with rich metadata, including scientific applicability. Metadata makes finding through search engines and deciding if a tool is of interest possible.


- ### F2.1. Structured Metadata

    Metadata is adjusted to specific metadata formats

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |Specific formats are more machine readable, which increases its findability by search engines| At least a source of structured metadata is considered valid. | all |


- ### F2.2. Standardized Metadata

    Metadata is described using accepted ontologies 

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    | The same piece of information about a software can be stated in many equivalent forms. Each tool being described with different terminology, with non specified meanings, makes metadata very hard to interpret. Automatic processing is also harder. When searching for a software with certain features, the lack of a consusuate terminology makes the process of searching slow and difficult. | EDAM, bioschema | all |
